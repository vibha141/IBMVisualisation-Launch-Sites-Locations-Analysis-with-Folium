Launch Sites Location Analysis with Folium.

The launch success rate may depend on many factors such as payload mass, orbit type, and so on. It may also depend on the location and proximities of a launch site, i.e., the initial position of rocket trajectories. Finding an optimal location for building a launch site certainly involves many factors and hopefully we could discover some of the factors by analyzing the existing launch site locations.


In the previous exploratory data analysis labs, you have visualized the SpaceX launch dataset using matplotlib and seaborn and discovered some preliminary correlations between the launch site and success rates. In this lab, you will be performing more interactive visual analytics using Folium.

# Objectives

This lab contains the following tasks:

TASK 1: Mark all launch sites on a map

TASK 2: Mark the success/failed launches for each site on the map

TASK 3: Calculate the distances between a launch site to its proximities

After completed the above tasks, you should be able to find some geographical patterns about launch sites.
